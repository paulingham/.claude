# Path-independent Quality Gate for /pr-creation Ship step.
# Exits 0 to proceed, 2 to block (PR_BLOCKED).
#
# Runs the full _qg_check_* suite (tests/lint/audit/shape/contract + freshness)
# regardless of which tool creates the PR: gh pr create, gh api, or MCP.
# A Bash hook matcher (hooks/quality-gate.sh:23) is path-dependent — it fires
# ONLY for `gh pr create`. This skill step is path-agnostic by construction.
#
# WHY: check loop MUST stay identical to hooks/quality-gate.sh:38-45.
# If you add a check there, add it here too (MCP/skill path vs Bash/hook path).
# GP-C1, issue #33106 — permissionDecision:deny is not enforced for MCP tools.
#
# Does NOT call _qg_finalize (needs pairing.sh + jsonl-emit.sh; a skill step
# is not a hook — event emission is a hook concern). Does NOT call
# check_hook_profile (profile-gating is hook-only). Issues its OWN verdict.
# Mirrors skills/pr-creation/lib/check-hook-pytest-gate.sh (exit-2 gate shape).
